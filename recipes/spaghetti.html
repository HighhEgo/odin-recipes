        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Fresh Tomatoes
                Try to stick with plum tomatoes, like Roma, San Marzano, and cherry tomatoes. Be sure to peel the tomatoes (and remove the seeds, if you like, but it's not necessary).</li>
                <li>White Sugar
                    The sugar will balance out the acidity and give the sauce a hint of sweetness.</li>
                    <li>Onion
                        Onions will add a depth of flavor to the sauce as they cook down.</li>
                        <li>Spices
                            Garlic powder, basil, parsley, and salt will increase the flavor of the sauce. We think the recipe is great as is, but some reviewers like to add additional spices, like oregano, red pepper flakes, or Italian seasoning.</li>

        </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the Tomatoes
                Blanch the fresh tomatoes to remove the skin. Feel free to remove the seeds, but it's not necessary because you can strain the sauce later or leave the seeds in the sauce altogether. 
                
                Chop the tomatoes into smaller pieces.</li>
                <li>Cook the Onion and Garlic
                    Add onion and garlic powder to a skillet with olive oil. Cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Boil the Sauce
                        Add the remaining ingredients and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the sauce thickens, about 1-2 hours. Serve immediately, or let cool and freeze.
                        
                        If the sauce is too chunky for your liking (or if you want to use it as pizza sauce), run it through a blender or food processor until it reaches your desired consistency.</li>
